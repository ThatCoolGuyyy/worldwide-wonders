# Worldwide Wonders

This project demonstrates localization in a Vue.js application, displaying a landing page for a fictional travel agency in multiple languages. It uses [`vue-i18n`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-i18n) for localization with locale messages stored in JSON files in the `src/assets/locales` directory. 
The locale is determined based on the URL path. For example, accessing `/en` will display the application in English, while accessing `/es` will display the application in Spanish.
